# Nuclear_Tools
An asortment of handy nuclear engineering tools

This package provides various simple Nuclear functions to quickly obtain data in a python environment such 
as converting weight fractions to atomic fractions, give molecular weight of compound such as UO2, give
atomic weights and binding energy per nucleon

This package is currently in the first stages of development but plans for a quick expansion to include many
other helpful tools.

Various functions rely on numpy, pint, and many other well known python packages.  Moreover this package 
utilizes Becquerel, a python package based around spectrum analysis and atomic information.  It was very
helpful in the development of Nuclear_Tools.


Please feel free to send in functions or classes that would be useful to classowork or research to have 
them added to the package.
